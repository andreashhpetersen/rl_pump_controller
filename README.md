# Reinforcement Learning based controller for extraction fields

This repository contains the code the thesis of Andreas Holck HÃ¸eg-Petersen
conducted at ITU in 2021.

The project was about using Reinforcement Learning to control the pumps at an
extraction field. The repository contains code for simulating an extraction
field (`environment.py`) and for training a model (`models.py` and `trainer.py`).

The code is published while it is not really pretty or easy to understand, but
changes will be made soon to make it accessible.

Until then, refer to `run_experiments.py`, `main.py` and `evaluate.py` to get a
sense of how to potentially use it.
